# nail-art-gallery
Welcome to my gallery! I created this site to compile my nail art from the past *4 years*. 

It does not contain all the images at this moment, but I hope to add all my work soon.

## Motivation
I began painting my nails every week once the pandemic began. It was a creative outlet that gave me routine in an uncertain time. I watched youtubers and browsed the internet for inspiration. Soon, I started doing nail art and featuring intricate designs on my nails. I slowly built up a collection of nail polish and tools at the same time.

I still do nail art as often as I am able with the same level of passion. It brings me joy to show my art to others. I hope this site can be used for others to look at my own work as well as for me to look back on how my skills have improved.

## Skills
To build this, I used **GitHub Pages** which utilized **HTML**. The data for each image is stored in a **JSON** file. The **JavaScript** file enables the use of buttons to denote categories and **CSS** was used to create the gallerty display itself.
